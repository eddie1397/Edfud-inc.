  <h3>My Story</h3>

  <p>My story starts a little different than most photographers. I was a little black boy that
    grew p on the west side of Chicago. I would always keep myself enthralled inside of video games
    in order to stay away from all of the danger outside. One day I was at a family party and my
    grandpa showed me this cool little box that made it possible to stop time. I was really confused
    at first then he worked his magic. I heard the box snap and thena mechanical buzzzzzzzzing.... </p>
